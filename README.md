# wl_result_scatterplot

Generates graphs for total, snatch, and clean and jerk vs body weight.
Use the dropdown menu to select body weight.

I wish there was a better way to generate the graphs. Perhaps it would be better to work with multiple tables in my database rather than one large table.

There are some django urls I made not relating to the graph for practice.
